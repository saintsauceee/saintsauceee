## Hey, Iâ€™m Donghao ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a 3rd year Computer Science undergrad at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), passionate about building scalable software and applied AI systems. I've built end-to-end RAG pipelines and AI-powered internal tools at [Digitech Payments](https://www.digitechpayments.com/), and led the development of a web-based video editor at [lemona.studio](https://lemona.studio/) with many cool LLM-powered features like Autocut, which automatically analyzes long footage, extracts key moments, and compiles them based on user prompts.
